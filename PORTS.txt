A site that serves on basic, smart and web has this convention.

We use up to 100 ports for each site. Ports are offset from a port base. A
typical port base is N=8100.

The Django processes use gunicorn and up to 4 ports per layer.

Web = N+11, N+12, ..., [N+14]
Basic = N+21, N+22, ..., [N+24]
Smart = N+31, N+32, ..., [N+34]

The Django process for admin runs on port N+91.

Haproxy is configured for conventional non-mobi devices on port N. It acts as a
normal load balancer.

Haproxy may ask a twisted process to do user-agent to layer mappings. It then
passes the request to a relevant Django backend.

haproxy device proxy = N+1
haproxy device proxy backends = N+2 (also port twisted device-proxy plugin runs on)
haproxy device upstream = N+9
