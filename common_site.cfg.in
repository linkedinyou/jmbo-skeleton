# Configuration for haproxy and deviceproxy is shared by all sites.
#
# Also, a configuration to set up nginx for sites that form a logical mobi site. Mobi
# sites are served from a single url, eg. m.site.com. device-proxy determines
# the correct instance.

# Do not edit unless you know what you are doing.
